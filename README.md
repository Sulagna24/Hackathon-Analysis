#Project Background#
 
A 2-day college hackathon organized by the technical club with **600 registrations and 550 final participants**. Analyzed participation and performance data using Python and Excel. Cleaned and standardized raw, unstructured data with typos and missing values. Engineered new analytical columns for insights on participation status, stage-wise progression, and winner selection patterns. 
    
- Cleaned and processed raw Excel data of **600 hackathon teams** using Python and Excel, fixing typos and handling missing entries.
- Engineered new columns such as **‘Submitted’, ‘Met Criteria’, and ‘Winner’ status** to enable layered analysis of event outcomes.
- Built a **drop-off funnel** to identify where teams exited the process (e.g., after participation, submission, evaluation stages).
- 
 **Executive Summary**
    
    The hackathon had an excellent turnout (92% participation rate). **Mentoring improved final project quality**, and team engagement was high across domains. 5 teams were awarded top honors based on creativity, feasibility, and implementation.
    
 **Registration & Participation Trends**
    - 600 students registered
    - 550 actually participated (8.3% drop-off)
 **Mentoring Session Insights**
    - **Mentoring Round 1**: 95% attendance, teams refined ideas
    - **Mentoring Round 2**: 88% attendance, final polishing and troubleshooting
    
Teams that attended both rounds had 30% higher project completion scores
        
5. **Project Submission Stats**
    - 470 teams submitted projects
    - 380 projects met basic criteria
    - 90 projects lacked innovation or were incomplete
6. **Top Performing Teams**
    - **Winners (Top 5)**: Tech Wizards, Code Force, Data Rangers, Script Squad, Algo Crew.
    - Chosen based on criteria: innovation, problem relevance, tech stack used, and idea and thought process.

7. **Team Size & Structure**
    - 80% worked in teams of 3–5
    - Solo participants had lower submission and satisfaction rates
8. **Satisfaction Survey Trends**
    - 85% participants were “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied”
    - Mentorship and judging fairness were most appreciated
9. **Strategic Recommendations**
- Conduct a pre-hackathon workshop
- Formalize mentor allocation per team
- Offer certificates (swags) to all participants
